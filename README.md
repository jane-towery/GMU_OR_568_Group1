GMU OR 568 Group 1's Term Project

# GitHub Basics
If you are new to GitHub then I would suggest using the GitHub desktop.  
Once you install Github desktop and then you need to use your GitGub credentials to login.

The next step would be to clone a remote repository. 
File -> Clone Repository
Select: GitHub.com tab (should already be selected, if not select it. )
Select: rmaxseiner/GMU_OR_568_Group1
Update: Local Path to the location where you would want to have the files stored on your local machine. 
Click: Clone

The files should be now on your local machine and you can edit as normal. 

# Opening the R Project
In RStudio do the following to create a new project with the GitHub files as its source. 
File -> Open Project 
select: GMU_OR_568_Group1.Rproj from the local path in the github set-up

# Making Changes visible to others
This is a two step process commit and then push. You essentially have a copy of the repository on your local machine, a branch.  
Commit says that you want to mark a set of changes in your branch. 
Push pushes the changes from your local repo to the main repo making it changes everybody can see them and pull them into their own branch.

In RStudio
Tools -> Version Control -> Commit
Select: The files you want to be included in the commit. 
Update: Comment with a description of the changes you made. 
Click: Commit 
Optional: Click: Push if you want to push to the main repo

If you didn't push the changes then you can do the following 
Tools -> Version Control -> Push Branch 
This will immediately push any commits to the main branch.




This is how I set-up the project but I don't think this is necessary. 
File -> New Project
Select: Create from Existing Directory
Update: Project Working Directory to what you have selected as your local path in the GitHub set-up
Click: Create Project
